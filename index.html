        <h2>TimeBlocking In Three Easy Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Plan your week</h3>
        <p>Planning your week should be the first thing you do on Monday morning. Looking at the work you have to do for the week and making time for it give you a better sense of how much time you really have. Make sure you leave time for administrative tasks, meetings, and breaks. The more you practice blocking out your week, the better you will get at estimating how much time you need.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Adjust your calendar as the week progresses</h3>
        <p>It is a good idea to keep your Google calendar open all day as you become accustom to this method, but as you get better you can do this once at the end of the day. As your day progress you should be continually adjusting the events on you calendar to reflect the reality of your week. This not only illustrates where all you time goes, but also it is a transparent road map for your upcoming work and priorities.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Review your actual time versus your planned time</h3>
        <p>With a premium account you can review your week, month and year analytics. This feature provides animated timelines, it shows you where you are spending your time and what is preventing you to sticking with your plans.</p>
